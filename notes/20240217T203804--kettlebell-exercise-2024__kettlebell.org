* IMPORTANT: I am copying the full SED (Swing Everyday) program below but please DO NOT just grab the plan and skip watching the video. It is ESSENTIAL that you listen to the programming points in the video – watch the ENTIRE thing!!! – to get the most from this plan and to ensure you don’t do anything stupid, LOL.

Also, I totally forgot to mention that we have our 300 Swings 2.0 Challenge right around the corner (starting next week!!!).
If you REALLY want to crank up the daily swing volume, and join an awesome community for a genuinely effective fitness challenge, please consider joining us. The price is really good and it supports everything  we do here on this channel.
