* How to go to the content of org-capture that i saved?
Org provides a couple ways to jump to the most recent captured item. The org-capture command can be called with a C-u C-u
prefix to jump to the last entry. For example if you have bound org-capture to C-c c you should be able to use C-u C-u C-c c.

By default org-capture will also set a bookmark org-capture-last-stored so you can jump there using standard bookmark
commands. For example, the default binding C-x r b (bookmark-jump) can be used to go to the bookmark set by org.
